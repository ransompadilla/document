Dear  Dr. Aparece;

	Good Day !

	I am Ransom Carino fourth year BSIT student of college of computer studies. I humbly request for addition of my subject practicum 41. The reason why i wasn't able to add my practicum 41 was because i was so occupied with my On The Job Training  having fun working with my teammate. Honestly i lose my time to add my practicum 41.
	
	I deeply apologize for the distubance, i really need to add practicum 41. please allow me to add the subject.

	I sincerely hope for your consideration, Thank you and GOD bless.






Sincerely Yours,
Ransom Carino
